Every developer has spent hours, or even days, chasing a bug. Effective debugging is a skill that separates junior developers from senior ones. It's not magic; it's a systematic process.

## Beyond `console.log`

`console.log` is the trusty tool of every JavaScript developer, but it's just the beginning. The browser's developer tools offer so much more.

### 1. The Power of `debugger`

Placing the `debugger;` statement in your code will pause execution when the dev tools are open. This lets you inspect the entire call stack, see the value of every variable at that exact moment, and step through your code line by line. It's like a time machine for your application's state.

### 2. Conditional Breakpoints

Instead of writing `if (condition) { debugger; }`, you can set a conditional breakpoint directly in the Sources panel of your dev tools. Right-click on a line number and select "Add conditional breakpoint...". The code will only pause if your condition is met. This is invaluable for debugging loops or frequently called functions.

### 3. Network Tab

Is your bug related to data fetching? The Network tab is your best friend. You can inspect the headers, payload, and response of every single request. You can even replay requests or copy them as `cURL` commands to test them in your terminal.

By mastering these tools, you can turn debugging from a nightmare into a satisfying process of discovery.
