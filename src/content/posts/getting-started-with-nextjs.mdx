Next.js has taken the React world by storm, and for good reason. It provides a robust, production-ready framework that simplifies many of the complexities of building modern web applications. If you're coming from Create React App or another client-side rendering setup, this guide will help you get started with Next.js.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Pages and Routing

The most fundamental concept in Next.js is its file-system based router. Any file you create in the `src/app/` directory automatically becomes a route.

- `src/app/page.tsx` maps to `/`
- `src/app/about/page.tsx` maps to `/about`
- `src/app/post/[slug]/page.tsx` maps to dynamic routes like `/post/hello-world`

This convention-over-configuration approach saves a ton of time and makes your project structure predictable.

### 2. Server Components

With the introduction of the App Router, Next.js defaults to using React Server Components. This is a major paradigm shift. Server Components run *only* on the server, meaning they can access databases, file systems, and other server-side resources directly, without needing to build a separate API layer. They also don't ship any JavaScript to the client, leading to much faster page loads.

You can opt-in to client-side interactivity by using the `'use client'` directive at the top of a file.

### 3. Data Fetching

In the App Router, data fetching is incredibly simple. Since components are async by default on the server, you can just `await` your data.

```tsx
async function getPosts() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
  return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const posts = await getPosts();

  return (
    <main>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <div key={post.id}>{post.title}</div>
      ))}
    </main>
  );
}
```

Next.js extends the native `fetch` API to handle caching and revalidation automatically, giving you fine-grained control over whether your data is static, revalidated periodically, or fully dynamic.

## Your First Page

To get started, install Next.js:
`npx create-next-app@latest`

Then, navigate to `src/app/page.tsx` and start building. The developer experience is fast, the hot-reloading is seamless, and the framework provides the guardrails you need to build a performant, scalable application. Welcome to the future of React development!
