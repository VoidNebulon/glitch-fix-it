State management is the cornerstone of any React application. With the introduction of Hooks, functional components transformed from simple UI renderers into powerful, stateful building blocks. Let's dive into the essential hooks for mastering state.

## 1. `useState`: The Foundation

The `useState` hook is your go-to for managing local state within a component. It's simple, powerful, and the first tool you'll reach for.

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**When to use it:** For simple, component-specific state like form inputs, toggles, or counters.

## 2. `useEffect`: Handling Side Effects

Your components often need to interact with the "outside world" â€“ fetching data, setting up subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. `useEffect` is the hook for that.

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchUser() {
      const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
      const data = await response.json();
      setUser(data);
    }

    fetchUser();
  }, [userId]); // Re-run the effect if userId changes

  if (!user) return <p>Loading...</p>;

  return <h1>{user.name}</h1>;
}
```
**When to use it:** For data fetching, subscriptions, timers, and any logic that needs to synchronize with external systems.

## 3. `useContext`: Avoiding Prop Drilling

Tired of passing props down through multiple levels of components? `useContext` provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

```javascript
// 1. Create a context
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

// 2. Provide the context value at a high level
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

// 3. Consume the context in any child component
function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <button className={theme}>I am a {theme} button</button>;
}
```

**When to use it:** For sharing "global" data like UI theme, user authentication status, or language preferences.

## Beyond the Basics

Hooks like `useReducer` offer more complex state logic management, `useCallback` and `useMemo` help optimize performance, and `useRef` gives you an escape hatch to interact with the DOM directly.

By understanding these core state management hooks, you'll be well on your way to building clean, efficient, and scalable React applications.
