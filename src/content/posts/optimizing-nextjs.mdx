Next.js is fast out of the box, but there are always opportunities to make it even faster. Here are five simple techniques to boost your app's performance and improve your Core Web Vitals.

## 1. Optimize Images with `next/image`

Don't use the standard `<img>` tag. The built-in `next/image` component automatically handles:
- **Resizing:** Serving the right image size for different devices.
- **Optimization:** Compressing images without losing quality.
- **Lazy Loading:** Loading images only when they enter the viewport.

## 2. Dynamic Imports

Don't load JavaScript for components the user might not see. Use `next/dynamic` to code-split and load components on demand. This is perfect for modals, complex charts, or anything below the fold.

```jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/HeavyComponent'))
```

## 3. Use Server Components

With the App Router, components are Server Components by default. This means less JavaScript is shipped to the client, leading to a faster initial page load. Keep components on the server unless they absolutely need interactivity.

## 4. Caching and Revalidation

Leverage Next.js's powerful caching strategies. For data that doesn't change often, use a long `revalidate` time with `fetch`. This means your pages can be served from a cache, making them incredibly fast.

## 5. Analyze Your Bundle

Use `@next/bundle-analyzer` to see what's inside your JavaScript bundles. You might be surprised by large dependencies you can replace with smaller alternatives. This is a crucial step for identifying and fixing performance bottlenecks.
