Web performance is not just a technical concern; it's a critical aspect of user experience. A slow website can lead to higher bounce rates and lower conversions. Let's look at key areas to focus on for a faster site.

## Image Optimization

Images are often the largest assets on a webpage.
- **Choose the right format:** Use modern formats like WebP or AVIF which offer better compression than JPEG or PNG.
- **Compress images:** Use tools like Squoosh or ImageOptim to reduce file size without sacrificing too much quality.
- **Lazy loading:** Use the `loading="lazy"` attribute on `<img>` tags for images that are below the fold. This defers loading them until the user scrolls them into view.

## Code Splitting and Minification

- **Minification:** Remove unnecessary characters (whitespace, comments) from your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Most build tools (like Vite or Webpack) do this automatically in production.
- **Code Splitting:** Break down your large JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand. Frameworks like Next.js and Remix do this automatically at the route level.

## Caching Strategies

Leverage browser and server caching to avoid re-downloading assets.
- **`Cache-Control` header:** Set this HTTP header to instruct the browser how long it can cache a response.
- **Service Workers:** For progressive web apps (PWAs), a service worker can provide granular control over caching, enabling offline access.

## Understanding Core Web Vitals

Google's Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics that measure real-world user experience for loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability.
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Measures loading performance.
- **First Input Delay (FID):** Measures interactivity.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Measures visual stability.

Focusing on these areas will not only make your users happier but can also improve your site's ranking in search results.
