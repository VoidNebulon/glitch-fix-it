React Hooks, introduced in React 16.8, revolutionized how we write components. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Let's explore some of the most important ones.

## useState: The Foundation of State

`useState` is the most fundamental Hook. It allows you to add state to your functional components.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
It returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it.

## useEffect: Handling Side Effects

`useEffect` is for side effects: things like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. It runs after every render by default, but you can control when it runs by passing a dependency array.

- **No dependency array:** Runs after every render.
- **Empty array `[]`:** Runs only once, after the initial render.
- **Array with values `[prop, state]`:** Runs only when those values change.

This control is crucial for performance and preventing infinite loops. Mastering `useEffect` is key to building complex React applications.
