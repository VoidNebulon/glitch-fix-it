Choosing a state management library for your React app can be overwhelming. Redux, Zustand, Jotai, Recoil, or just the Context API? Let's break down the current landscape.

## The Classic: Redux

Redux has been the standard for years. It's powerful, has a massive ecosystem, and its DevTools are unparalleled. However, it's often criticized for its boilerplate. Redux Toolkit has significantly reduced this, but it can still feel heavy for smaller projects.

## The New Wave: Zustand and Jotai

Libraries like Zustand and Jotai offer a much simpler, hook-based API. They are minimal, require very little boilerplate, and are often easier to pick up for developers new to global state management.

Zustand is particularly popular for its simplicity and flexibility. It feels like a simple `useState` but for your entire app.

## Don't Forget Context

For simple state that needs to be shared between a few components, React's built-in Context API is often enough. Before reaching for a third-party library, ask yourself if you can solve the problem with `useState` and `useContext`. This is often called "prop drilling," but for many cases, it's a perfectly acceptable and simple solution.

There is no "one size fits all" solution. The right choice depends on your team's experience, the complexity of your app, and your personal preference.
