Every developer, regardless of experience level, spends a significant amount of time debugging. It's an essential skill, and mastering it can dramatically increase your productivity and reduce frustration.

## `console.log` is Your Best Friend

The simplest yet most powerful tool in your debugging arsenal is `console.log()`. Don't hesitate to use it to inspect the state of your variables, check the flow of your application, or confirm that a function is being called.

For objects and arrays, `console.table()` can provide a much clearer, tabular view of your data.

## Master Your Browser's DevTools

Modern browsers come with incredibly powerful developer tools. Here are a few features you should get comfortable with:

*   **The Debugger:** Set breakpoints in your code to pause execution and inspect the call stack, scope, and variable values at that exact moment.
*   **The Network Tab:** Analyze all network requests made by your application. This is invaluable for debugging API calls.
*   **The Console:** Beyond `console.log`, you can execute JavaScript directly in the console to test out ideas or inspect the `window` object.

## A Systematic Approach

When faced with a bug, avoid randomly changing code. Instead, follow a systematic approach:

1.  **Reproduce the bug:** Consistently reproduce the issue.
2.  **Isolate the problem:** Narrow down the part of the code where the bug is occurring.
3.  **Form a hypothesis:** Make an educated guess about what's causing the bug.
4.  **Test your hypothesis:** Use `console.log` or the debugger to see if your guess is correct.
5.  **Fix and verify:** Apply the fix and ensure it solves the problem without introducing new ones.
